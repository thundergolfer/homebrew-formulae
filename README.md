### [`goodreads-sh`](https://github.com/thundergolfer/goodreads-sh)

Simple CLI tool to track you and your friends' reading on Goodreads
without using Goodreads's at times annoying web interface.

### [`slackify-markdown`](https://github.com/thundergolfer/slackify-markdown)

Simple CLI tool to convert Markdown into Slack's bastardized Markdown-like formatting.

I made it so that my ['Slack-ups'](https://medium.com/@ryzmen/in-our-company-we-started-doing-slack-ups-variation-of-stand-ups-on-slack-channel-d93076270727), written in Markdown in [Notion](https://www.notion.so), can be converted easily to Slack format and copied into my team's channel.
